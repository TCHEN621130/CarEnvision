## About
CarEnvision is a program that predicts your car's future or past values given a specific year.  
The information is extracted from Cars.com and placed through Machine Learning algorithms to predict a final value.  
Predicted value is based off of sentiments from professional car enthusiasts.  
We used three sets of car examples in order to train our Machine Learning algorithms.
